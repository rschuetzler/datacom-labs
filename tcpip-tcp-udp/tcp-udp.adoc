= Lab Exercise: TCP and UDP
ifndef::bound[:imagesdir: figs]
:icons: font

The two most common transport layer protocols are TCP and UDP.
While both protocols have a few things in common, like ports, they are very different in the way that they operate.
In this exercise you will look at the differences in the way the two protocols operate as they send both short and long messages to their destination.

== Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, you should have a basic understanding of the following terms:

* TCP
* UDP
* Ports

=== Install Wireshark

.  Go to https://www.wireshark.org/download.html and download the appropriate version of Wireshark for your _host_ operating system
.  Run the installer to install both Wireshark and the packet capture driver (`winpcap` for Windows)

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-  Explain the differences between TCP and UDP
-  Use Wireshark to view and analyze TCP and UDP data streams
-  Use `netcat` to send messages on a network

== Steps

In this section, the "host" refers to your computer. "Guest" refers to
the virtual machine running inside your computer.

=== Initialize VMs

* Create a new folder on your computer for this exercise.
* Copy the `Vagrantfile`, `bootstrap.sh`, and `dangerous.txt` from the
lab materials to the directory
* Open a Git Bash and navigate to the folder.
** (Remember Start > cmd [enter], `cd`, `md`)
* Run `> vagrant up` to initialize the virtual machines for this lab.
** The two machines you'll be using here are named `alice` and `bob`.
** This step may take a little bit as software is installed for this
lab.
* Open a second Git Bash and navigate to the same directory.
You'll need connections to both Alice and Bob simultaneously.

=== Gather information

* In one Git Bash, connect to Alice with `> vagrant ssh alice`.
From the other, connect to Bob with `> vagrant ssh bob`.
* To use the `tshark` program, you need to know the name of the interfaces you'll be using.  On each VM, run the command `$ ifconfig`, then look at the results of the command.  The interface we'll be using for this lab is the one with the `inet addr` on the 192.168.100.0 subnet.  The interface name is on the left.  In the screenshot below, and throughout this lab, you'll see `enp0s8`.  Substitute your own interface name whenever you see that value in a command.

* Determine the IP address of the `enp0s8` interface of each VM. Record
the IP addresses in the assignment submission, and keep them handy.
You'll need them soon.

=== Examining short messages in UDP

* `tshark` is a version of Wireshark designed to run on the command
line.
* To install `tshark` on alice, you'll need to run the command on the following line.  You can examine the `bootstrap.sh` file to see what it does.  Simply put, it fetches the latest version of the package repository for Ubuntu and installs `tshark`.  Then it changes permissions on one file which will allow you to run `tshark` without being an administrator or `sudo`.
** When presented with the dialog asking 'Should non-superusers be able to capture packets?': Select "<Yes>"

 $ sudo bash /vagrant/bootstrap.sh

* Before executing any commands at this stage, review the entire
section. Once you start `tshark`, you'll have a limited amount of time
to complete the other steps, so you want to be ready for them. It may
even be wise to try running the `netcat` commands on each machine to
make sure you understand them, then do it again with `tshark` running to
get the packet capture.
* The following is the command to run the `tshark` program in the
background so we can complete the other commands. You should change the
`duration:[number]` option to a number of seconds. This is how long (in
seconds) `tshark` will run before automatically stopping and saving the
capture to a file. Give yourself plenty of time, but not so long that
you have to wait a long time for the program to finish its job.
** `-f "not broadcast and not multicast"` filters all packets that are
not send directly to the computer doing the capture.
** `-i enp0s8` tells tshark to capture packets on the `enp0s8` interface,
which in this case is the network interface connecting Alice and Bob.
Use `ifconfig` or `tshark   -D` to get a list of possible network
interfaces.
** The `-a duration:30` option tells tshark to run for 30 seconds before
automatically finishing its capture (adjust this time as necessary to
give yourself enough time to finish typing all of the `netcat` commands
before the capture quits).
** The `-w /vagrant/udp.pcap` option tells tshark to save the output of
the capture to the file `/vagrant/udp.pcap`.
** The `-Q` option tells tshark to do its capture quietly, without any
output to the terminal. This is important due to the next command...
** `&` at the end of any Linux command tells it to run in the
background. This will allow us to execute other commands while the
capture is running.

 $ tshark -f "not broadcast and not multicast" -i enp0s8 -a duration:30 \
 -w /vagrant/udp-short.pcap -Q &

NOTE: The `\` in the above command is only needed because this command spans two lines.
If you type it out in one line, you can omit the `\` after `duration:30`.
The backslash tells the shell that you're going to keep typing parts of the command on the next line.

* Start wireshark (with `tshark` on Alice)
* Use `netcat` to set up listening on a UDP port on Alice.
** The `-u` tells netcat we'll be using UDP.
** Finall, `-l 4242` tells netcat to listen on port 4242.

 $ netcat -ul 4242

* Use netcat to send a UDP message to Alice from Bob
* Enter the following command at Bob's command prompt to open a
connection to Alice, substituting Alice's IP address where indicated
(remove the `<>`).

 $ netcat -u <Alice's enp0s8 IP Address> 4242

* Once the connection has started, type a brief message (1 or 2
sentences) and hit Enter to send.
* After the message is sent, hit CTRL+C on Bob to end the `netcat`
connection. Switch over to Alice and type Ctrl+C again to stop
listening. Wait for your `tshark` session to end (at whatever time limit
you set).

=== Examining UDP in Wireshark

On your host computer, open up a file browser (e.g. Windows Explorer)
and find the directory you created for this lab. There you should find a
file named `udp-short.pcap`. This file should contain all of the packets sent
between Alice and Bob while your tshark session was running. Open that
file in Wireshark.

* Answer the questions in the submission file regarding your short UDP
message.

=== Examining TCP

Now we will send a short message (the same short message as before)
using TCP instead of UDP.

* Start `tshark` again, changing the name of the output file to
`/vagrant/tcp-short.pcap`. This is important, because you may want to
review the UDP and TCP files to answer some of the questions in the
submission.
* On Alice, run `$ netcat -l 4242` to start listening on port 4242
* On Bob, run `$ netcat <Alice's enp0s8 ip address> 4242` to open a
connection
** Type your short message and hit Enter to send.
** Type Ctrl-C to end your connection. This will also close `netcat` on
Alice.
* Wait for your `tshark` session to end.
* Open `tcp-short.pcap` in Wireshark on your host computer and use it to
answer the questions in the submission file.

=== Longer messages

In this section we will use netcat to send the contents of a text file
as if we had typed it. This will let us see how UDP and TCP handle
sending and receiving longer messages.

* Open the `dangerous.txt` file you copied from the lab documents. It
should contain the entire contents of the short story "The Most
Dangerous Game" by Richard Connell. As long as it's in the same
directory as your Vagrantfile, can access it on your Linux VMs at
`/vagrant/dangerous.txt`.

==== UDP

* Start `tshark`, outputting to the file `/vagrant/udp-long.pcap`.
* Start `netcat` on Alice listening for a UDP message (`-u`) on port
4242.
* On Bob, send the contents of the `dangerous.txt` file over UDP with
the following command:

 $ netcat -u 192.168.100.10 4242 < /vagrant/dangerous.txt

* You should see the contents of the file appear in Alice's terminal.
* Press Ctrl-C on both VMs to stop netcat, then wait for your tshark
session to end.
* Open `udp-long.pcap` in Wireshark on your host, and use it to answer
the questions in the submission document

==== TCP

* Start `tshark` with the filename `/vagrant/tcp-long.pcap` as the
output.
* Start `netcat` on Alice listening for a _TCP_ message on 4242.
* On Bob, send the contents of `dangerous.txt` over TCP to Alice
* Wait for your `tshark` session to end, then open `tcp-long.pcap` in
Wireshark on your host.
* Answer the questions in the submission file

=== Cleanup (Optional)

After submitting your work, you can destroy any boxes you used.

* Run "`$ exit`" to leave the SSH session. You will be back at your
regular command prompt.
* Run "`> vagrant destroy`" to turn off the machines and delete them
completely from your system. Answer "y" to confirm deletion.

== Questions

. What are the IP addresses of Alice and Bob?

[width=40%,options="header"]
|==============================
| VM name | IP address 
| Alice   |            
| Bob     |            
|==============================


=== UDP short message

[start=2]
. What are the source and destination ports of the UDP datagram?
. What are the source and destination IP addresses of the message?
. How many UDP packets did it take to send your short message (hint: only count packets
   captured that list UDP as the protocol)?
. How many total bytes (from all packets) were required to transmit this message (add up
   the "length" of all UDP packets)?
. How many bytes of data were sent (hint: click the packet in Wireshark and look at the
   "Data" section).

=== TCP short message

[start=7]
. What are the source and destination IP addresses of the message?
. What are the source and destination ports of the TCP datagram?
. How many TCP packets did it take to send your short message (hint: only count packets
   captured that list TCP as the protocol)?
. How many total bytes (from all packets) were required to transmit this message (add up
   the "length" of all TCP packets)?
. How many bytes of data were sent (hint: find the message in Wireshark and look at the
"Data" section).

=== TCP & UDP long messages

[start=12]
. The `netcat` program can be used to transfer the contents of files between
   machines. You transferred a large file to the stdout (aka the terminal) on Alice's
   computer using the `netcat [ip] [port] < filename.txt` syntax on Bob. If you had typed
   `netcat -l [port] > filename.txt` on Alice, that output would have gone into a
   file. Would TCP or UDP be better used for a file transfer like this, and why?
. How many packets did UDP take to send the message? What about TCP? Can you explain why?

=== Critical thinking

[start=14]
. What are two important differences between TCP and UDP when sending short messages?
. Why would someone choose to use TCP to send short messages (e.g. IRC for chat
   or SMTP for short emails)?
. Name a service that uses UDP, and explain why.
. Why don't you have to close netcat manually when you use TCP to send a long file?
