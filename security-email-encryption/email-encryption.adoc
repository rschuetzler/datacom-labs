For this lab, you will use public key encryption to send and receive encrypted emails.
To send and receive encrypted emails requires that both you and your communication partner have created a public and private _key pair_ and have shared your *public* keys with each other.
The private key in a key pair should always be kept private (hence the name).
If you do not have another communication partner, or are completing this for one of my courses, you can send me an encrypted email at ryan@schuetzler.net.
You can find my public key next to the little key icon at https://keybase.io/rschuetzler.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you will have a better understanding of the following ideas:

- How to send and receive encrypted email
- How a public and private key pair can be used
- How to digitally sign an email message
- What encryption and digital signatures do

There are two equally valid options for completing this lab.
The first option uses your web browser and a browser extension called https://www.mailvelope.com/en/[Mailvelope].
If you are used to using webmail like Gmail to do your emailing, you will probably want Option 1.
The second option uses an open source mail client (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/[Thunderbird]).
If you are already using Thunderbird, or used to using something like Outlook, you may be more comfortable with Option 2.

== Option 1: Mailvelope

https://www.mailvelope.com/en/[Mailvelope] is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows you to use PGP keys in popular webmail clients like Gmail.
It integrates directly into the user interface of your favorite mail client so you can send and read encrypted emails.

=== Setting up Mailvelope
. Make sure you are using either the Chrome or Firefox web browser. Mailvelope only works with those two. I use Chrome, so the tutorial steps here will be for that. Steps in Firefox should be pretty similar.
. Go to https://www.mailvelope.com/en/ and click the link on the page to install the extension for your browser.
. Click the extension's icon in your browser, then click "Options" at the bottom of the popup window. This should take you to the "Setup" tab of the Mailvelope extension.

[start=4]
. Click "Generate key" to create your first key pair.
.. Fill out all fields.
.. Make sure you select a unique password, as this will be used to make sure your private key stays private.
.. Optional: You may select the box to "Upload public key to Mailvelope Key Server" if you choose.

NOTE: A key server is used to distribute and share public keys.
Putting your public key on a key server just makes it easier for people to find your public key and encrypt messages to you.


You now have a working key pair that can be used to receive encrypted email, or digitally sign your outgoing messages.

=== Sharing public keys

In order to send an encrypted message to someone with public key encryption like what we are using here, you need your recipient's public key.
For others to send you encrypted message, they will need your public key.
One way to share public keys is to place them on the key server as we talked about in the step above.
You could also post the public key on your website to provide some proof that the key belongs to you.
Another option is just to send them in an email.

==== Exporting your key

WARNING: Remember to *_never_* share your private key.
Be careful when you are exporting your keys that you only export your public key.
Don't make the mistake https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/09/23/adobe-security-team-posts-public-key-together-with-private-key/[Adobe made].

[start=5]
. Go to the "Display Keys" tab and click the key you want to export.
. Click the "Export" tab of the modal dialog.
. Before you export, make sure you only select "Public"!
. Click "Save" to download your public key.
. Share the public key with whoever you are wanting to send messages to you. You can share the key through email, a flash drive, or any other way that you would share a file. You could even post it on your website so the whole world can know the public key belongs to you.

==== Importing another key

To send encrypted messages, you need to have the recipient's public key.
Once you have a text-friendly form of their public key, you can import it into Mailvelope.
You can do that either as a file or by copying the text.
My public key is available at https://keybase.io/rschuetzler/pgp_keys.asc?fingerprint=565df5e50b4ca56c8c08aadfd149ca54b652a40f

[start=10]
. Go to the "Import Keys" tab of Mailvelope.
. Import the public key
.. If the user has shared their key with you as a text file (usually ending with a `.asc` file extension), click "Select a key text file to import", find the key file, and import it.
.. If you have found the key somewhere else (like mine linked above) and just want to copy the raw text in, you can use the "Import key as text" field to paste the key.
.. If the key is on a key server you can use the box for Key search to search several different key servers.

WARNING: Be careful with trusting unknown public keys, as anyone can create a public key with any name or email address.
A key server does not perform any identity proofing of the keys, so you could create a key claiming to be Ben Affleck just as easily as you could for your own name.
Just because you find a public key with someones name on a key server does not mean the key actually belongs to that person.

==== Sending encrypted and signed mail

Now that you have your own key pair and the public key of your desired recipient, you are ready to send an encrypted message.
I'll be using Gmail as an example here, but Mailvelope works for others, including Outlook.com and Yahoo.

[start=12]
. Open your email inbox. If it was already open, make sure you refresh the page so Mailvelope's integration can load.
. Click the button to compose a new message.
. You will see a small compose button pop up in your new mail window

.Mailvelope compose button
[align=center]
image::mailvelope-compose.png[Compose button]

[start=15]
. Select the recipient of your message (e.g., ryan@schuetzler.net)
.. If your intended recipient is not showing up, make sure you have imported their public key.

NOTE: You must select all recipients in the Mailvelope Compose window or they will not be able to read the encrypted message.
If you select other recipients in the regular email window, they will receive an encrypted message that they cannot decrypt.

[start=16]
. Click the "Options" button at the bottom of the window, and check the box to "Sign message with key".
. Click the "Encrypt" button.
. Enter the password for your private key.

image::mailvelope-window.png[Mailvelope's compose window]

You should see a whole bunch of gobbledygook in a new mail window starting with `-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----`. This is your PGP encrypted message. Select a recipient, give the mail a subject line, send it.

==== Reading encrypted mail

When you receive an encrypted message, it is a simple process to read it.

[start=19]
. Open the email as usual in your browser
. Mailvelope will detect that it is an encrypted message and display a pop-over allowing you to click to decrypt the message.
.. You may need to enter the password for your private key again. That is because the private key is used to decrypt a message destined for you.

image::mailvelope-decrypt.png[Decrypt the message]

[start=21]
. Read the encrypted message in your browser window
. In the top right you can see if the message has been digitally signed. You can also click "Signed digitally" to view the key that was used to sign the message.

== Option 2: Installing and configuring GPG and Thunderbird
If you don't use webmail, or don't trust a web browser to handle your security for you, you have other options!
There are some great free tools for enabling you to use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) or GPG (Gnu Privacy Guard, a free, PGP-compatible encryption tool) to encrypt and sign all of your emails.
Here we'll use Thunderbird, an open source email client from Mozilla, the same team that makes Firefox.
Enigmail is a popular security plugin for Thunderbird that handles the GPG encryption.
You'll also install a GPG application for your operating system.

=== Creating your keys ===
. Go to https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/download to download and install the Mozilla Thunderbird email client
. Set up Thunderbird to use whatever email address you want to use for this lab. 
.. If you want to use Gmail, make sure that you have IMAP enabled. Do this by clicking the gear icon and selecting "Settings." Then go to the "Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab" and select "Enable IMAP."
.. If you're still having trouble getting it set up, there is a link to configuration instructions at the bottom of that page. Follow https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/1668960?rd=1#ts=1665018,1665141[these instructions] to configure Gmail in Thunderbird.
. Install the GPG implementation for whichever platform you are using (Windows or Mac)
.. On Windows, go to http://www.gpg4win.org/ to download GPG (the Gnu Privacy Guard).
.. On a Mac, go to http://gpgtools.org/ to download GPG Tools. After you install, it will ask if you wish to run GPGtools. Just close it, as you will generate our keys through Thunderbird.
. Once you have both GPG and Thunderbird installed, install the Enigmail add-on for Thunderbird (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/enigmail/).
. Restart Thunderbird, and you will be prompted to configure Enigmail
. Follow the setup wizard prompts to generate your public and private keys
.. Select "Convenient auto encryption" when it is displayed. Also select to sign all of your messages by default.
.. Opt to "Create a new key pair" and follow the instructions on screen.
.. When prompted, you may create the revocation certificate if you wish. You won't need it for this lab, but if you want to continue using email encryption, it's a good idea.

TIP: Revocation certificates are used to effectively "cancel" a key.
This can be done if a private key has been compromised, or is no longer in use.
Sharing the revocation certficate tells people (and programs) that a key no longer is used by its original owner.

=== Exchanging public keys and sending emails ===

As you have learned, asymmetric (public key) encryption works because
you can share your public key with anyone, and they can use that public
key to encrypt a message meant just for you. In this section of the lab
we will exchange public keys so that we can send each other encrypted
messages

[start=7]
. Press the "Alt" key to bring up the menu in Thunderbird.
. Select "Enigmail" and then "Key Management"
. You will be presented with a list of keys installed on your computer (probably just your own)
. Install your recipient's public key
.. Go to https://keybase.io/rschuetzler/pgp_keys.asc
.. Right-click on the page, select "Save as..." and save the file as `schuetzler.asc`.
.. In the "Key Management" window, select "File" -> "Import keys from file"
.. Right-click on the new key and select "Sign key". Signing keys is your way of indicating that you trust they key, and that you believe it truly belongs to me.
. Send your own public key to your recipient
.. Right-click your name in the "Key Management" window and select "Send Public Keys by Email"
.. Enter the email address of your recipient.
.. Type the body of your email.
.. Select the option to "Encrypt and sign the message text, but not the attachments." This will send your public key in plain text. Remember that that's okay; anybody can have your public key and it won't compromise your own security. So there's no harm in having your public key intercepted or shared.

== If you'd rather

It is possible to send encrypted mail with Apple Mail, Outlook, or other mail clients.
Feel free to use Google to find out how to send GPG encrypted messages if you have a different preferred email client.
