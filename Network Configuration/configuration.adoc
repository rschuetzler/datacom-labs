= Exercise 2: IP Configuration

Internet Protocol (IP) addressing helps to identify the location of machines on a network and facilitates routing messages between machines. 

== Prerequisites
Before starting this lesson, you should have a basic understanding of the following terms:

* [IP Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)
* [Subnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork)
* [Subnet mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork#Subnetting)
* [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)
* [Default Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_gateway)

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

. Use `ipconfig` and `ipconfig /all` on Windows to view network configuration.
. Use `ifconfig` to view Linux network configuration.
. Use `ip route show` to view Linux the default gateway on Linux.
. Display the Linux network configuration.
. Use network tools `ping` and `tracert`, and understand what they do

== Steps

In this section, the "host" refers to your computer. "Guest" refers to the virtual machine running inside your computer.

=== Step 1: Setup and Connect to a Linux Guest

In this step, you will create a 64 bit Ubuntu Linux virtual machine.

* Create a new folder on your computer for this exercise.
* Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder.
** (Remember Start > cmd [enter], `cd`, `md`. Refer to the first exercise for more detailed instructions on creating and navigating folders in a command prompt.)
* In the command prompt, run `> vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64`
* Run `>vagrant up` and then `> vagrant ssh` to connect to the machine.

=== Step 2: Discover the Guest Network Configuration

The default Vagrant box comes preconfigured with networking capability. In this section, you will issue commands to discover what networking is enabled by default.

* Run `$ ifconfig`
** `ifconfig` is a Linux command that shows the network "**i**nter**f**ace **config**uration."
* Two connections will be listed. We are concerned with the "eth0" interface. The "eth0" is a simulated Ethernet (wired) connection.
* Find where the output says "inet addr". This is the Internet Protocol (IP) version 4 address.
** Like all IPv4 addresses, it is composed of 4 numbers between 0 and 255,
   separated by periods. IP addresses within a network must be unique because
   they identify a specific machine. IP addresses are much like mailing
   addresses. If two people had the same mailing address, mail carriers would
   not know where to deliver the mail. IP addresses on a network must be
   unique. Most operating systems will give you a warning if you try to connect
   to a network with a duplicate IP address.
* The "Mask" identifies the subnet (i.e. sub network).
** At a high level, subnets are used to separate traffic to allow for more
   efficient communication. An analogy is a single large classroom where four
   classes are simultaneously being taught. It would be difficult to communicate
   in such a crowded classroom with students asking questions of the various
   instructors and instructors trying to be heard over the noise. It would be
   more efficient if the single large classroom were broken down into four
   distinct classrooms. This way, the communication for each class would be
   contained in a separate classroom. One of the primary benefits of subnetting
   is the ability to regulate traffic. Ideally, as much traffic as possible is
   kept on the same subnet.
* The "HWaddr" is the hardware address. This is the media access control (MAC)
  address. Each MAC address is unique across the entire world. There are two
  parts of a MAC address--the hardware vendor identification and the device
  identification. Every piece of network equipment created by Cisco will start
  with the same ID, but each device will be unique. This convention is a
  standard that all device manufacturers follow. It should be noted, however,
  that users can "spoof" their MAC address, changing it from the address defined
  in hardware to something that the user chooses in software.
* The output of the `ifconfig` command also lists the amount of data sent (`TX`
  or transmitted) and received (`RX`).

You will become more familiar with these terms throughout the exercises. For now, it is most important that you know where to find this information.

=== Step 3: Discover Your Windows Host Network Configuration

This step assumes that you are using a Windows host.  If you are not using a
Windows host, use a library computer or borrow a friend's Windows computer to
complete this section.  Because you'll be using a variety of operating systems
in your career, you'll need to be familiar with networking basics on both major
systems---Windows and \*nix (including OS X).

* Open a new command prompt on your host machine.
* Run `> ipconfig` to show the Internet Protocol configuration.
** This is a tremendously important command. Remember it.
** The number of interfaces depends on the number of network adapters on your
   machine and software installed (such as Virtual Private Network [VPN]
   software or VirtualBox).
** Look for a connection named "Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection" or something similar.
** What do you notice that is similar and different from the `ifconfig` output?
* Run `> ipconfig /all` and scroll to find the same "Ethernet adapter" you
  looked at in the previous step.
** Notice that the Windows `ipconfig /all` command shows the Default Gateway,
   Domain Name Server (DNS), and Dynamic Control Host Protocol (DHCP)
   information that the Linux `ifconfig` does not show.

=== Step 4: More Linux Guest Network Configuration

Windows makes it easy to see the DHCP configuration and DNS configuration in one place. This same information can be obtained in Linux, but the information is located in several parts of the system. Linux follows the Unix convention of having small utilities do one job and do that job well.

* Run `$ ip route show`
* The output will show "default via x.x.x.x" (where x.x.x.x is the IP address of the default gateway).
** The default gateway is the node that knows how to send data to other networks (networks outside of the current subnetwork).
* More information can be found in the network configuration file. In Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu), run the following command:
** `$ cat /etc/network/interfaces`
** The `cat` command prints the contents of files to your shell.
** `/etc/network/interfaces` is a text file that contains networking configuration.
** You should notice that at the end of the file, there is a `source` command
   that loads all network configurations in the `/etc/networking/interfaces.d/`
   directory.
* Run `$ cd /etc/network/interfaces.d/`
* Run `$ ls` to **l**i**s**t the contents of the folder.
** There should only be one file in the folder: eth0.cfg.
* Run `$ cat eth0.cfg` and you should see output similar to the following:

 auto eth0
 iface eth0 inet dhcp

* The configuration tells us the following facts about the network:
** `auto eth0` tells the system to load the network interface at boot
** `iface eth0 inet dhcp` tells the system to obtain an IP address automatically
* There are several ways to get DNS information. In the case of this VM, the DNS
  information was obtained via DHCP and automatically written to the
  `/etc/resolv.conf` file.
** Run `$ cat /etc/resolv.conf`
*** Look for the IP address of the nameserver
** Run `$ dig google.com` (or use another website)
*** The "SERVER:" line will contain the DNS server.
* It is possible to manually define the default gateway, DNS, and IP addressing
  in the network configuration file (e.g. eth0.cfg), but it is usually best to
  let the system obtain this information automatically.


=== Step 5: Use the Windows Graphical User Interface to Discover Network Configuration

* Click Start > Control Panel
* In the "Search Control Panel" text box, type "network connections."
* Click the "View network connections" link.
* The list of network adapters you see should be the same as the list you saw
  when you ran `ipconfig.`
* Right-click on your active network interface and choose "Properties." Your
  active network connection will likely be your wireless or local area
  network. If there is a red X on a network connection, it means that it is not
  being used (such as not having an Ethernet cable plugged in). Some connections
  might be disabled. Be sure to choose the connection that is enabled and
  connected. You should see something like the screenshot in Figure 1.

![Windows Connection Properties](windows_connection_properties.png "Windows Connection Properties")

* Click on Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), and click Properties.
** Here, you can view or change how your computer obtains an IP address.
** On this screen, you can also change the DNS information.
** Click "Cancel" to exit without making any changes.
* Under the name of your network adapter, click "Configure..."
** Click the "Advanced" tab, and select "Network Address." The Network Address allows you to specify a new MAC address.
** By default, "Not Present" is selected. If you select "Value" and type in a new address, Windows will use the value you entered instead of the actual MAC address of your network adapter.
* Close the network configuration screens.

Note that in Windows, you could discover network configuration from the command prompt (using `ipconfig`). Changes are typically made using the graphical user interface. Microsoft has a more sophisticated version of the command prompt called PowerShell which can also be used to view and make changes to system configurations. PowerShell has a unique scripting language that is beyond the scope of this class. If network administrators were to make changes to a large number of computers on a network, it would be much easier to create a Powershell script to do it than to use the GUI. If a single network configuration had to be diagnosed, it is often easier to use the graphical user interface.

=== Step 6: Ping and Tracert

Modern computers come equipped with several tools to help troubleshoot your network.  The most common network troubleshooting command is `ping`. Ping is one of the tools in the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). Every modern operating system comes with the `ping` command, which sends out message called an *echo request*. This is a polite way that your computer can ask another computer if it is there. If the echo request has any trouble getting to its destination, the router that identifies the issue can send back an error message.  If the message arrives successfully at its destination, the destination computer can respond with an *echo reply* message.  In this portion of the lab, we will use the `ping` command to talk to a server.

* Open a connection to your VM with `> vagrant ssh`
* Once you are connected, type the following command to send an echo request to one of Facebook's servers: `$ ping -c 4 www.facebook.com`. On Linux, the `ping` command will run until you tell it to stop. The `-c 4` we put in tells it to run just 4 times.
** Enter the required information for question 6 on the submission page.
* Now ping the localhost IP address: `127.0.0.1`. This is your computer's way of checking on itself.

Another very useful tool for larger network troubleshooting is the trace route. This tool uses a series of pings with increasing time-to-live (TTL) to create a map of the route between your host and your destination. It is installed by default on Windows with the command `tracert`. On OS X, the command is `traceroute`, and is also installed by default. In newer versions of Linux, you may need to install the `traceroute` package separately.

* From your host OS, issue the appropriate traceroute command, followed by google.com. On Windows, that would be `tracert google.com`. Wait while the command executes.
** Fill out the approriate answers to the questions on the submission form.
* Now go to http://www.monitis.com/traceroute/ This website is a visual traceroute tool that allows you to visualize the route from their company's servers to whatever site you specify.
** On the site, enter the URL of the University's homepage to perform the
      traceroute. Report the results (including a screenshot of the map) in the
      submission form.
* (optional) If you want to see a geographical traceroute from your computer to
  another server, you can check out the Open Visual Traceroute tool
  (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openvisualtrace/). This is free software that
  runs on Windows, OSX, and Linux. Because it's running on your computer, it can
  show you traffic from you to the server, rather than from one server to
  another as in the other tool used above.


=== Step 6: Cleanup (Optional)

After submitting your work, you can destroy any boxes you used.

* Run "`$ exit`" to leave the SSH session. You will be back at your host command prompt.
* Run "`> vagrant destroy`" to turn off the machine and delete it completely from your system. Answer "y" to confirm deletion.
