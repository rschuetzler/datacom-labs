= Routing
:imagesdir: figs

In the days of the first computer networks, communication within a
single network provided tremendous value. Networked computers could
connect to printers, file servers, and each other. But the full power of
networked communications could only be realized when computers could
communicate across networks. To communicate across networks, data must
be routed. In this lesson, you will learn several routing protocols, and
you will configure a Linux server as a router.

== Routing

Routing can be explained by considering the post office analogy.
Consider each city as an individual network. The Las Vegas post office
knows where to deliver each piece of mail to every address within its
city limits. However, if it receives a piece of mail destined for San
Diego, the Las Vegas post office does not know where in San Diego that
address resides, and it cannot deliver the mail itself. The Las Vegas
post office _routes_ the mail to the San Diego post office. The Las
Vegas post office knows that Interstate 15 is the fastest way to get to
San Diego, so it puts the letter in a van and sends it on its way. When
the letter gets to San Diego, the people in the San Diego office know
how to deliver the message to the local recipient.

The main purpose of routing is to get data where it's supposed to go as
quickly and efficiently as possible. Routing is what occurs between
networks. The technology underlying the current Internet and modern
computer networking was created in a time when nuclear war was
considered a likely possibility. Because an entire city might be
destroyed, hardware and software were created to be fault tolerant.
Sophisticated routing protocols were created that could adjust routing
on the fly in case a node in the network failed. We will cover four
basic routing protocols.

== Routing Protocols

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table[_Routing tables_] determine
what path a router chooses to send data. At a high level, routing tables
contain the destination, paths to get to that destination, and a rating
for how fast and reliable that path is.

Suppose you were to construct a routing table for Chicago. The _Network
Destination_ would be the place you ultimately want to end up at. The
_Gateway_ is the next intermediate hop to get to your final destination.
The _Interface_ is the network adapter (or transportation method in this
example) that can be used to reach the next hop. The _Metric_ defines
the cost of the route, basically how fast and reliable it is.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===============================================
|Network Destination |Gateway |Interface |Metric
|Minneapolis |Milwaukee |Bus Stop downtown |500
|Minneapolis |Milwaukee |Helicopter Pad |5
|===============================================

If you want to get to Minneapolis from Chicago, you must pass through
Milwaukee. There are two possible routes defined in the routing table
above--a bus and helicopter. The metric for the helicopter is much
lower, so the router will choose this route. The router in Milwaukee
will have its own routing table for the most efficient way to send data
from Milwaukee to Minneapolis.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===================================================
|Network Destination |Gateway |Interface |Metric
|192.168.100.15/24 |192.168.100.1 |192.168.0.100 |10
|===================================================

The above routing table has a single entry. It says that if data needs
to get to the 192.168.100.15/24 network, it should send it to
192.168.100.1 using the network card with the IP address 192.168.0.100.

Every workstation, server, and router has a routing table. In windows,
type the command `> route print` to list the routing tables. There will
be separate tables for IPv4 and IPv6. Take a minute to look at the list.

image::windows-route-table-entry.png[Windows Routing Table Entry,title="Windows Routing Table Entry"]

The 0.0.0.0 network is the default network. If traffic is being routed
to a network that is not listed in the routing table, it will be routed
through the specified Gateway and Interface. In this example, my home
router has the IP address 192.168.1.1. So if I try to access an IP
address that my computer does not recognize as a local address, it sends
it through my router and off to my internet service provider.

When I run `ipconfig` on my Windows workstation, I can see that my
wireless network card has the IP address 192.168.1.244.

image::windows-ipconfig.png[Windows IP Config Output,title="Windows IP Config Output"]

There may be entries in your routing table to the same Network
Destination but through different interfaces. Each interface can have a
different Metric, and the computer will use this metric when deciding
which interface to use.

== https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_routing[Static Routing]

Static routing is the simplest way to configure routing, though it is
only useful for very simple networks. Static routing requires that every
routing entry on every router be configured manually. A human being must
type in each of the routes. If something changes in the network
configuration, all of the routes must be updated manually.

Imagine a small satellite office where four employees work. The four
employees connect to a local printer, but most of the resources they
access are on the main campus. A simple static route could forward any
non-local traffic to the main campus router. Essentially, there would be
a single route.

Large organizations cannot use static routing exclusively.
Administrators would have to ensure that dozens or hundreds of routers
and thousands of routes were properly configured. It would be time
consuming and prone to errors. There may be situations, however, where
static routing makes sense, but on a limited scale.

=== https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_Information_Protocol[Routing Information Protocol (RIP)]

The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) was one of the first routing
protocols. It calculates the cost of sending data based on the number of
hops required to reach the destination. This is similar to airline
flights. A direct flight from Los Angeles to New York is a single hop. A
flight from Los Angeles to New York that stops in Las Vegas and Denver
would be three hops. So in theory, the direct flight should be fastest.

RIP is limited to 15 hops, so it is unsuitable for very large networks.
However, it is simple to deploy and widely supported.

=== https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First[Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)]

The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol is currently the
most common in large organizations. The protocol discovers the network
topology surrounding, creates routing tables based on distance,
bandwidth, and reliability. OSPF can detect changes and adapt
automatically. OSPF is very performant and scales to large networks. It
has another advantage over RIP, in that it does not flood the networking
with routing table updates every 30 seconds, but only when link state
information changes.

=== https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Standby_Router_Protocol[Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)]

Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) is not a routing protocol, but a way
to make the default gateway fault-tolerant. Routing is an essential part
of network communication, and a routing going offline can have severe
consequences.

== Configuring a Router

In this example, we will have three networks. The "Ace" network has
"alice", "amy", and "arouter". The "Blaster" network has "bob", and
"brouter". The "Intermediate" network connects the two routers. The
following lists the IP addresses of the network devices.

image::Simple-routing-instructions.png[Network Configuration,title="Network Configuration"]

Note that the diagram shows distinct cables connecting the devices.
However, Vagrant essentially puts them all in the same physical space.
The machines will have to be configured to appear like they are distinct
physical networks.

=== Setup and Connect to a Linux Guest

* Copy the Vagrantfile for this exercise to a folder.
* Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved the
Vagrantfile.
** As a shortcut, you can open the folder in a Windows explorer folder,
hold shift, right-click, and choose "Open command window here." Be sure
to right-click on an empty part of the folder and not a specific file.
* Run `vagrant up` to bring up the machines.
** Note that because six machines are defined in the Vagrantfile, any
Vagrant command that does not target a specific machine will
automatically target all machines. Because you are creating _five_ VMs,
it will take several minutes for this command to complete.

Note that _five_ virtual machines will be created. The machines are
named alice, amy, arouter, bob, and brouter. You might be surprised that
arouter and brouter are just regular virtual machines, but routers are
basically just computers. Most router hardware strips away uneeded
operating system functionality (like graphical user interfaces), but the
underlying networking capabilities are equivalent to what you would find
in any modern operating system.

=== Discover the Guest Network Configuration

The default Vagrant box comes preconfigured with networking capability.
In this section, you will issue commands to discover what networking is
enabled by default.

//TODO: Create network diagrams for each phase, so students can see what the network looks like as they work on things 

* Run `> vagrant ssh alice`
* Run `alice$ ifconfig`
** eth1 will have the interface used for this exercise. We will pretend
that this is the only network interface on the machine.
** eth0 exists so that your host machine can communicate with the guest.
If you delete this interface, your SSH session will die.
* Run `alice$ tracepath 192.168.10.11`
** `tracepath` comes with the default Ubuntu installation. It is similar
to the `tracert` command in Windows, or the `traceroute` command that
can be installed on *nix systems. The `tracepath` command shows the
different hops or routes through a network that are required to reach a
remote host.
** This will attempt to find the path to amy. This should be successful
since they are on the same network.
** Because alice and amy are on the same subnet, no routing is required,
and so there are no routers present in the path.
* Run `alice$ tracepath 192.168.10.5`
** This should also be successful, since the internally facing interface
of the router is on the same network.
* Run `alice$ tracepath 192.168.3.5`
** This will fail. The externally facing interface of the router is not
on the same network. The command will fail at 10.0.2.2--your host
machine. Your host machine does not know how to route the traffic to the
appropriate network. The traffic is not being routed properly.
** Press `control+c` to stop the tracepath command.
* Run `alice$ netstat -rn` to show the routing table.
** You should see output like the screenshot below.

image::netstat-alice-pre.png[Alice Routing Table,title="Alice Routing Table"]

** There are three entries in the routing table.
*** The 0.0.0.0 network (the default network if no other networks apply)
*** The 10.0.2.0 network (the network shared with your host machine,
allowing vagrant ssh to work)
*** The 192.168.10.0 network (the local network)
** Because there is no routing entry for the 192.168.3.0 network, it is
going to the default route defined for the 0.0.0.0 network--eth0 (your
host machine). Since your host machine doesn't know how to access
192.168.3.5 either, the tracepath fails.

Two things must be done to fix the routing: 1. Add a new entry in
alice's routing table to direct traffic through arouter 2. Properly
configure arouter as a router. Currently it's just a computer with two
network cards. It knows it is connected to the two networks, but it
doesn't know what to do about it.

=== Modify Network Routing Configuration

* Run
`alice$ sudo route add -net 192.168.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.10.10`
** This previous command adds a new static route. Any traffic from alice
destined for the 192.168.3.0/24 network will be directed through the
192.168.10.10 network interface.
*** sudo: runs the command in privileged mode
*** route: accesses the routing table
*** add: inserts a new entry
*** -net: specifies the network destination to add
*** gw: gateway. The local network interface to route through
* Run `alice$ tracepath 192.168.3.5` again
** The command should succeed.
* Run `alice$ tracepath 192.168.20.11`
** The command will fail. Look back at the network diagram. Use the
diagram to help explain why this fails in your submission. Run
`alice$ netstat -rn` and include a screenshot of the output in your
answer.

=== Router Configuration

Currently, arouter and brouter are just computers with multiple network
interfaces. Their settings need to be updated to enable routing
functionality.

* Open a new command prompt and SSH into arouter with
`> vagrant ssh arouter`.
* Run `arouter$ sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf`
** Uncomment "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" by deleting the "#" character at
the beginning of the line.
*** This line enables routing by telling the computer to forward packets
for other networks.
** Save the file and exit.
* Run `arouter$ sudo sysctl -p`
** This command reloads the configuration changes made with the previous
command.
** You should see the output "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1".
* Run `sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart`
** This restarts the networking service to ensure that all configuration
changes are running.
* Run
`arouter$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth2 -j MASQUERADE`
** This enables routing functionality.
* Complete the above steps again on brouter (you should open a new
command prompt).

Now, some manual routes need to be added to arouter and brouter.

* Run
`arouter$ sudo route add -net 192.168.20.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.3.6`
* This command tells the `a` router how to route traffic to the `b`
network.
* Run
`brouter$ sudo route add -net 192.168.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.20.5`

=== Client Configuration

Currently, Alice still will not be able to route to 192.168.20.11. Her
routing tables have not been updated. Specifically, Alice's default
gateway, or default route, is still set to the `eth0` interface, which
connects to the host computer rather than to the other computers on the
network. Here we'll correct that.

==== Alice

* Run `alice$ sudo route del default`
** This command deletes the default gateway.
* Run `alice$ sudo ip route add default via 192.168.10.5`
** This tells the machine that traffic should be routed through eth1 by
default if it cannot find the destination.
** Essentially, we are pointing alice to the correct router.
* Run `alice$ tracepath 192.168.20.5`
** The command should succeed.
* Run `alice$ netstat -rn` and examine the routing table.
** Include a screenshot of the output in your submission.
* Run `alice$ ping -O 192.168.20.11`.
* This is an attempt to communicate with Bob on the Blaster network.
* The `-O` argument tells the ping command to report when there is no
response.
* The ping command sends an ECHO_REQUEST message to the destination
computer, which then responds with an ECHO_REPLY message of its own.
* At this point, you should not be receiving responses from Bob. The
ping command should say "no answer yet for..." Why are you not getting a
response yet?
* Leave the `ping -O` command running on Alice while we finish
configuring Bob

==== Bob

At this point, Alice is able to send messages to Bob, but Bob still
doesn't know how to send messages back to Alice. Bob's router knows how
to get back to Alice's network, but Bob isn't configured to use that
router as the default gateway. We'll fix that here.

* Connect to Bob with `> vagrant ssh bob` from a new host machine
command prompt
* Run `bob$ sudo route del default`
* Before you run the next command, be sure you can see Alice's ping
command running. Watch what happens when you run this next command,
configuring Bob's default gateway.
* Run `bob$ sudo ip route add default via 192.168.20.5`
** This tells Bob to use his router's interface as the default gateway.
* You can use CTRL-C in Alice's command prompt to stop the ping once the
output changes from "no answer yet"
* Answer the questions in the submission form regarding what happened
when you updated Bob's default gateway.

=== Cleanup (Optional)

After submitting your work, you can destroy any boxes you used.

* Run "`$ exit`" to leave the SSH session. You will be back at your
regular command prompt.
* Run "`> vagrant destroy -f`" to turn off the machines and delete them
completely from your system. Note that the `-f` command is to force the
command to run without prompting you to delete each machine.
