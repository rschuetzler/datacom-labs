= Metasploitable Installation Instructions

Metasploitable is a Linux distribution that is intentionally vulnerable to attack. Metasploitable was built to work with the VMWare virtualization platform. While some VMWare products are free for personal use, they must be purchased for use in classroom or company environments. This lab will guide you through using VirtualBox to setup and use Metasploitabe.

== Prerequisites

VirtualBox installed

== Download and Extract

1. Download the latest Metasploitable release from http://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/.

2. Unzip the downloaded file. You should see a list of files similar to the following screenshot.

5. Any memory between 512 MB and 1024 MB should work okay. Adjust the memory size depending on your available resources and how many other virtual machines you will be running simultaneously.

10. Start the Metasploitable-2 virtual machine.

11. Login with the username `msfadmin` and the password `msfadmin`.

12. Check the ip address by running `ifconfig`. If no IP address is set, set it to 192.168.2.50 using the following command.
+
```
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.50
```
+
You will be prompted for the password (`msfadmin`).

13. Verify that the IP address was set correctly by running `ifconfig`.

Now, any virtual machine using an "Internal Network" adapter in the 192.168.2.0/24 network range should be able to connect to the Metasploitable-2 VM.
