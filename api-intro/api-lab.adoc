Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a key part of building many useful applications today.
If an application provides an API, it can allow others to build new things with the functionality provided.
In this assignment, you will investigate web APIs in two different ways: Zapier, and Postman.
After working with these two tools, you will better understand how APIs function, and how you might use them in an application that you build.

== Using Postman
When you need to interact directly with APIs, whether creating or consuming them, it is helpful to have a tool to let you see what's going on with your requests.
Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) calls itself the world's only complete API Development Environment.
I have no way to verify that statement, but I can say that it's a very useful tool for testing out requests to an API to (a) see what it returns and (b) make sure it returns what you want it to.
In this part of the lab, you will use Postman to send some API requests and see how the data is formatted when it comes back.

=== Setting up
. Go to https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/ and download the version of Postman appropriate for your OS.
. Install the application
. Run Postman on your computer
. You can either choose to create a free Postman account, or you can click the little gray link at the bottom of the window to skip signing up and go straight to the app.
. In the window that appears, choose the option to create a Collection. I called my collection "API Basics."

=== Using a basic API
Now that we have a project, we're going to look at what happens when we use an API.
We'll start off with the simplest API call possible.
It has no parameters, and no authentication.
We'll use the API from https://shibe.online to get a random picture of a dog.

[start=6]
. Click the "..." next to your new collection and choose the option to "Add Request"
.. Name the request "Random Dog" and save it to your collection.
. Open the request and enter `https://shibe.online/api/shibes` where Postman asks for the request URL.
. Make sure the request type is "GET" (check the dropdown to the left of the URL)
+
NOTE: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` are the most common request types used when accessing APIs. These are HTTP request methods, and you can find more information about when to use each here: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp.

. Click btn:[Send] to send the request.
. In the box at the bottom, you should see the response from the API that includes a single URL. If you copy that URL into a web browser, you'll see that it's a picture of a dog, as promised.

=== Adding parameters
Some APIs use URL parameters to specify additional information when fulfilling requests.
For example, our Shibe API allows us to specify how many dog pictures we would like (up to 100) using the `count` parameter.

[start=11]
. Under the request URL in the Params tab, put in `count` as the Key, and `5` as the value.
. Click btn:[Send] to see the result of this query. You should receive a list of 5 URLs, each with their own random dog picture.
. Add a second parameter for `httpsUrls` with a value of `false`. Send and check the list and notice that the URLs returned are now `http` instead of `https`.
+
NOTE: Notice that changing the parameters also changes the URL in the bar above. It adds `?count=5&httpsUrls=false` after the URL that you previously put. That is how parameters are passed in HTTP GET requests. Postman makes it easier to set different parameters by presenting them in a table instead of in a long string. You can copy the exact same URL into your browser and see the results there as well. Try it: `http://shibe.online/api/shibes?count=10&httpsUrls=false`.

=== POSTing
Not all requests to APIs can be done with an HTTP `GET` request. 
Usually if you are submitting data in some form to an API, you will use a `POST` request instead.
For this section we'll create a POST request for a different API to send some text. 
We'll use my very own homegrown shouting API to convert some input text to uppercase.
The shouting API accepts a JSON-formatted input and gives back an ALL-CAPSified version of the input string.

[start=15]
. Create a new request in the collection by clicking the "..."
. Change the request type from GET to POST
. Enter the URL: `http://api.is404.net/shout.php`
. Don't add anything to the "Params" tab. Usually with HTTP POST requests, data is passed in the message body instead of as part of the URL.
. Go to the Body tab, select `raw`.
. For the dropdown on the right, select `JSON`.
.. Check the Headers tab and note that a `Content-Type` header has been added. This header tells the API what type of data you are willing to accept. In this case, you are telling the server that you will only accept JSON in return.
. In the input box, enter what you see below
+
[source,json]
++++
{
    "input": "put in some of your own text",
    "section_number": <your section>
}
++++

image::postman-post.png[]
. Click btn:[Send]. You should get back a response with one value: "shout" that contains the CAPSed version of your text.
// . Go to http://api.is404.net/+<sectionnumber>+ to see if your message got posted, and to see what your colleagues are sending.

=== Authentication
Authentication for APIs can take many different forms.
Many APIs use a secret key that is passed either as a parameter or as part of the header.
Others allow you to use a username and password directly.
Still others use OAuth, an open standard for authentication.

Learning how to authenticate with an API is beyond the scope of this lab because getting an API key usually involves creating an account somewhere.
If your experimentation takes you to an API that requires a key, you'll likely need to create an account to get the API key.
If it requires OAuth, you'll have to do some work to figure out how to use it.

TIP: There are some great resources out there for learning how OAuth works. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4727226/on-a-high-level-how-does-oauth-2-work has a good real life comparison.


=== Experimentation
Now that you have the basics of how to use an API with Postman, dig around on your own and learn something new.
Look for new APIs at https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis or other sources.

[start=24]
// . Visit http://api.is404.net/docs to see documentation for all the APIs available at this site. See if you can get another one to work.
. Create requests to interact with 3 different APIs besides those described here. Show it to your neighbor an explain what it does.
. What have you learned about APIs from this lab?
. What challenges did you face from this lab?
