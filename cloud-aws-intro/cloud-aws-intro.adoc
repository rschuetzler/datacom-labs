Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the largest providers of cloud computing services in the world.
They offer a huge array of services, from databases to VMs to speech recognition.
While there are hundreds of cloud providers to choose from, it's a smart career move to get familiar with AWS because of their market share.
In this lab you will use AWS Educate, Amazon's educational program, to get some free credit that you can use to create servers on Amazon's infrastructure.

IMPORTANT: When you are done with the lab, you can manually stop the lab. Otherwise it will continue to accrue charges when you are not using it.

== Objectives

* Sign up for AWS Academy
* Become familiar with the AWS Academy lab portal
* Create a virtual machine on AWS and connect to it from your computer
* Create a static website on AWS that can be accessed from anywhere

== Signing up for AWS Academy
The first step to getting set up is to sign up for AWS Academy.
As a university student, you have access to (some) AWS resources for free, including a large set of courses that you can use to learn about what AWS can do.
If you are enrolled in one of my classes, you should be able to access AWS Educate through a link in your course.

. Check your email for a signup link from AWS Academy.
. You can then continue with the lab starting with <<academy-lms,the AWS Academy LMS>>.

== [[academy-lms]]The AWS Academy LMS

As I already explained, AWS Academy is Amazon's student developer partnership that gives you access to a whole bunch of free learning resources.
We will use some of the free academy credits for activities in this course.
After the course is over, you might have some credits left over that you can play with.

In the LMS modules page, you'll see a link to the student guide and another link to the Learner Lab - Foundational Services.
To enable AWS services, you'll go through the "Foundational Services" link.
Once there, you'll be able to start the lab.

The "Lab" in the AWS Academy is a temporary environment for working with AWS services.
To help students avoid situations where they turn on a big server, leave it running, and run out of credits in the first week of class, the AWS Lab turns off most services after 4 hours.
In AWS, a "running" server is one that is currently turned on; a "stopped" server is one that is currently shut down; and a "terminated" server is deleted.
So when your services stop after 4 hours, that doesn't mean your work is gone. 
It just means you have to come back and turn the lab on to get it running again.

== Starting a server

The simplest and most basic thing you will want to do to get started with AWS is to start up a virtual machine server. 
On AWS, these servers are called "EC2 Instances."
Your EC2 server will be running in an Amazon data center somewhere in Virginia, and we will connect to it using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.

TIP: EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud. You'll notice as you look around AWS that there are a lot of acronyms and weird names for things.  Check out https://expeditedsecurity.com/aws-in-plain-english/[AWS in plain English] to get an idea what some of them mean. And that's just a start! Look at https://aws.amazon.com/products/ for a bigger AWS product list.

We're first going to create an EC2 instance.

== Steps involved to create a static website
 
  * Launch an AWS Linux instance.
    * Go to AWS Management console and then launch a virtual machine with EC2.

    * Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance. Select one option from Amazon Linux.

    * Choose an Instance Type which is free tier eligible i.e. t2.micro. Amazon EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types optimized to fit different use cases. Instances are virtual servers that can run applications. Click Next.

    * Keep default of the _Configure Instance Details_ and _Add Storage_. Click Next for _Add Tags_.
    
    * In Add Tags, add key value pair as Name: MyFirstWebsite. Click Next for _Configure Security Group_

image::Tags.jpg[title="Tags"]

    * A security group is a set of firewall rules that control the traffic for your instance. On this page, you can add rules to allow   specific traffic to reach your instance. For example, if you want to set up a web server and allow Internet traffic to reach your   instance, add rules that allow unrestricted access to the HTTP and HTTPS ports. You can create a new security group or select from an existing one below. Add the security group of SSH, HTTP, HTTPS as shown below:

    * Click _Review and Launch_ the instance. After verifying, Click on _Launch_
    
    * Download the PEM file i.e Key Pair as shown below and secure it in your system.

  * Once Instance is launched, you can see the instance running in your EC2 Instances as shown below.
  
image::running_instance.jpg[title="Instance"]
  
  * Open cmd and connect to your server using command shown below. Keep your pem file and the IP address handy. Type yes to authenticate your connection. You will be able to connect to the Amazon EC2.

NOTE: If you're using PuTTY, you need to first convert the `.pem` file into something Putty can use. Instructions to do that are here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html

```
  ssh -i "your pem file" ec2-user@"your IPv4 Public IP"
```
  
  * Switch to the root user by invoking command 
```
  sudo su -
```
  
  * Go to /var and create folder www/html if not existing.
  
  * Create index.html file using the `nano` editor.
```
  nano index.html
```
  
  *  Add your html contents in this file. Add and edit the html file to see the changes.
  
[source,html]
----
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
</body>
</html>
----

  * Install Apache web server through command.  
```
  yum install httpd
```
  
  * Start the server.
```
  service httpd start
```
  
  * Check the status. It should be in running stage.
```
  service httpd status
```
  
  * Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to the Public DNS or IPv4 from your instance. You should see your website up and running.

== Ideas for Exploration
There are so many services on AWS that you could play around with.
With the starter account you won't have access to everything, but you'll be able to play around with a lot of the services that would be needed to create a website.
Also, with the starter account you can use whatever services you want and when the credits run out, your services will shut down, so you won't be charged.
Note, if you used your own AWS account when you signed up, then you can be charged if you use services beyond the credits provided with the class.

Investigate some other services available on AWS, and learn what they do and how to use them.
It can be overwhelming to see dozens or even hundreds of options, but with time and experience, it will become less confusing. 

IMPORTANT: Remember: when you are done with the lab, make sure you stop the lab. You may also choose to delete (terminate) resources that you don't want to use anymore. 
Otherwise they will continue to accrue charges.
