= Port Scanning with Nmap
ifndef::bound[:imagesdir: figs]

== Learning Objectives

By the end of these you will have experience with the following technologies and concepts:

. Network scanning with Zenmap (an `nmap` GUI)
. Understand what information can be gained with freely available port scanning tools
. Understand service discovery and "security through obscurity"

== Installation

You can download Zenmap from https://nmap.org/zenmap. This will include an installation of nmap, the command line application that does the actual network scanning. Be careful to only run Nmap (or Zenmap) port scans against services and sites you are authorized to scan. I'll give you a few to play around with in this class, but running port scans against unauthorized sites is almost always a violation of the terms of service of those sites, and can get you blocked.

== Nmap Network Scanning ==
=== First Scan ===

The folks an `nmap.org` have configured a great first site to scan, at `scanme.nmap.org`. 

. Launch Zenmap.
. In the target, enter `scanme.nmap.org`.
  - The command text box will show "nmap -T4 -A -v scanme.nmap.org"
. In profile, keep the "Intense Scan" option.
. Click Scan.
  - The scan can take a minute to run.
. Look at the output in the Nmap Output tab.
  - Examine the different tasks that `nmap` completed.
. Examine the Ports/Hosts tab.
. Examine the topology tab.
. Examine the Host Details tab.
. Examine the Scans tab.

=== Other Scans
For this class, I've set up a few other hosts with a variety of services running. Run scans against these just like you did with `scanme.nmap.org`. Review the information in the tabs and record what you learn. What services are running, and what ports are they using? Where are the servers relative to one another?

- `ice.is404.net`
- `honey.is404.net`
- `mixed.is404.net`

=== Service Discovery

Nmap has the ability to perform service discovery. This is useful because sometimes people attempt security through obscurity by changing the port a service like SSH uses.

- Set up a port scan on `mixed.is404.net`
- Select the option to run an "Intense scan, all TCP ports"
- Change the port scan options to include a `-sV` to instruct nmap to do service discovery

What services are running, and what ports are they using?

=== Think about it

What have you learned about network security from running Nmap? How does this affect your view of securing network resources? What does this say about the role of the firewall.

=== Learning More

Now that you've got a feel for what nmap can do, dig around in the documentation at https://nmap.org/book/man.html to see what else you can do with it. What can you learn about network-connected resources? Feel free to play around with and do anything you want to the 2 is404.net servers.

Now that you've done some scanning, I'll tell you that `honey.schuetzler.net` is running a special network defense application called HoneyDB (https://honeydb.io/). Search for more information about what HoneyDB can do.
